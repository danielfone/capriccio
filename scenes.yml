  description: |
    You wake up in your cabin to the gentle hum of the SS Nostalgia Voyager’s
    engine. Your head feels like it’s been spun around Jupiter a few times, and
    for good reason—last night you decided to participate in the ship’s new
    “Zero-G Oxygen Bar Experience.” As you recall, the signature cocktails had
    names like Nebula Nebbiolo and Galactic Goji, served in anti-gravity pouches
    by a robotic arm that insisted on high-fiving you every time you took a sip.

    The cabin lights flicker momentarily—a barely noticeable tremor that
    CAPRICCIO pretends didn’t happen. “Please proceed to the Guest Lounge when
    ready. Have a spectacular day among the stars!”
