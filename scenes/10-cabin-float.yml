    You open your locker. The mag boots are turning slowly behind a half-empty bottle
    of Ol' Janx Spirit, as the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger bumps gently against
    other assorted bottles. It occurs to you that you've never tried to mix a
    Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the float before.

    Now that the emergency is over, you feel a little more relaxed. You could use a drink.

    Surely the engines can wait a little longer.
  exits:
    a-drink: against your better judgement, mix a drink

    You mix the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster as if you've done it a thousand times before. You drink it… carefully.

    It feels, as they say, like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

    You feel better now, more confident, more alive. You consider looking for the others to celebrate your success. But first…
  exits:
    a-hazy-return: "just one more drink :)"
