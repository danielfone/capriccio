    You come to in your cabin. The opulent burn of a Pan Galactic Gargle
    Blaster still lingers on your throat. You feel a strange sense of deja vu.
    Your head throbs in time with the ship's engines.

    The ship's engines?! Hadn't they been off? You remember being on
    the float… the vertigo of open space… you were looking for something.

    A cheerful sounds over the intercom: "Good morning all passengers, welcome
    to day TypeError: date is null. Starship Enterprises is pleased to announce
    that we are scheduled to shortly reach the Jovian system. Please report to
    the galley for an emergency meeting at your earliest convience. DON'T
