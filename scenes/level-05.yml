    Finding your way back to the airlock is much faster now that you know the
    way. You cycle the airlock and start spinning down the corridors rather
    recklessly. Like a school kid on a shopping trolley, the novelty of gliding
    has somewhat gone to your head.
  exits:
    l5-your-cabin-float: float backwards through the door to your cabin

    Somehow, the cabin seems smaller when you're floating in it.

    Your locker hangs above you. Your hand terminal floats nearby with a
    notification on the screen.
  exits:
    l5-your-locker-keypad-float: open locker
    l5-hand-terminal: read the notification

- id: l5-hand-terminal
  name: The hand terminal
  description: |
    It's a message from your local Ruby group, reminding you that the next
    meet up is in two weeks. You suddenly recall your password… it was the
    middle name of your favourite meetup organiser!
  exits:
    l5-your-cabin-float: let the terminal float away
    l50your-locker-keypad-float: twist awkwardly to the keypad

    The keyboard glows unethusiastically.
  lock:
    prompt: "Password"
    answer: "Stephen"
    opens: l5-your-locker
    errors:
      - "That is not the correct password"
      - "Try again"
  exits:
    l5-your-cabin-float: bounce off in frustration

    You open your locker. The mag boots are tumbling slowly behind a half-empty
    bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit. It occurs to you that you've never tried to mix a
    Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the float before.

    Now that the emergency is over, you feel a little more relaxed. You could use a drink.

    Surely the engines can wait a little longer.
  exits:
    l5-a-drink: against your better judgement, mix a drink

  name: One drink in
  description: |
    You mix the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster as if you've done it a thousand times before. You drink it… carefully.

    It feels, as they say, like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

    You feel better now, more confident, more alive. You consider looking for the others to celebrate your success. But first…
  exits:
    a-hazy-return: "just one more drink :)"
