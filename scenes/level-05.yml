    Finding your way back to the airlock is much faster now that you know the
    way. You cycle the airlock and start spinning down the corridors rather
    recklessly. Like a school kid on a shopping trolley, the novelty of gliding
    has somewhat gone to your head.

    Somehow, the cabin seems smaller when you're floating in it.

    Your locker hangs above you. A post-it note floats nearby, it must have
    been hidden under the locker.
  exits:

    A handwritten scrawl reads: "the code is the middle name of your favourite meetup organiser"

    The keyboard glows unethusiastically.

    prompt: "Password"

    errors:
      - "That is not the correct password"
      - "Try again"

    You open your locker. The mag boots are tumbling slowly behind a half-empty bottle
    of Ol' Janx Spirit, as the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger bumps gently against
    other assorted bottles. It occurs to you that you've never tried to mix a
    Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the float before.

    Now that the emergency is over, you feel a little more relaxed. You could use a drink.

    Surely the engines can wait a little longer.
  exits:

    You mix the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster as if you've done it a thousand times before. You drink it… carefully.

    It feels, as they say, like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

    You feel better now, more confident, more alive. You consider looking for the others to celebrate your success. But first…
  exits:
    a-hazy-return: "just one more drink :)"
