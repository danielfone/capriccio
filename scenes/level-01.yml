    Conciousness gradually returns. You feel slightly groggy. How much time has passed?
  exits:

  name: "Cabin 23-B"
  description: |
    You come to in your cabin. The opulent burn of a Pan Galactic Gargle
    Blaster still lingers on your throat. You feel a strange sense of deja vu.
    Your head throbs in time with the ship's engines.

    The ship's engines?! Hadn't they been off? You remember being on
    the float… the vertigo of open space… you were looking for something…

    A cheerful voice sounds over the intercom: "Good morning all passengers,
    welcome to day TypeError: date is null. Aphelion Adventures is pleased to
    announce that you will shortly reach the Jovian system. Please report to the
    galley for an emergency meeting at your earliest convience. DON'T PANIC."
  exits:
    l1-your-cabin: get up

  name: "Cabin 23-B"
  description: |
    The cabin is small, but comfortable. The ship's engines hum softly beneath
    you. You can see Jupiter through the window, a little smaller than the moon.

    Your personal locker is in the corner. A door leads out to the corridor.
  exits:
    l1-your-locker-keypad: check your locker
    l1-corridor: go through the door

  name: Your cabin locker

    The keyboard glows unethusiastically. You can't remember the code, but you're
    sure it'll come back to you.
  exits:
    l1-your-cabin: give up for now

- id: l1-corridor
  name: Corridor
  description: |
    The corridor is empty. On both sides, doors lead to the cabins of the other
    passengers. At the end, the access hatch to the galley is closed.

    Halfway down, one of the cabin doors has been left open. You can see a
    glowing light inside. Passenger cabins are strictly private, but no one
    seems to be around.
  exits:
    l1-access-hatch: open the access hatch
    l1-other-cabin: violate the privacy of another passenger
    l1-your-cabin: return to your cabin

- id: l1-other-cabin
  name: A cabin you shouldn't be in
  description: |
    The cabin is empty, but a screen has a TV show paused on it. You don't
    recognise it, but the title bar says `S01 E18 Numbers`. They must have
    been watching it before they left for the emergency meeting.
  exits:
    l1-corridor: leave the cabin

- id: l1-access-hatch
  name: Access hatch to the galley
  description: |
    The access hatch is locked.
  lock:
    prompt: "Enter 10 digit access code"
    answer: "4815162342"
    opens: l1-galley-access
    errors:
      - "Incorrect code"
      - "Try again"
    hints:
      - Maybe the other passengers needed a reminder of the code before they left their cabin?
      - I suspect the episode in question will help you with the lock.
      - Try researching "S01 E18 Numbers" and use 6 numbers you find.

  exits:
    l1-corridor: go back down the corridor

    ✅ The access panel flashes green and the hatch opens with a hiss.

    A short ladder leads down into the galley. You can hear the murmur of voices
    below.
  exits:
    l2-galley-meeting: descend into the galley
