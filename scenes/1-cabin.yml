    You come to in your cabin. The opulent burn of a Pan Galactic Gargle
    Blaster still lingers on your throat. You feel a strange sense of deja vu.
    Your head throbs in time with the ship's engines.

    The ship's engines?! Hadn't they been off? You remember being on
    the float… the vertigo of open space… you were looking for something.

    An overly cheerful sounds over the intercom: "Good morning all passengers,
    welcome to day TypeError: date is null. Starship Enterprises is pleased to
    announce that we are scheduled to shortly reach the Jovian system. Please
    report to the galley for an emergency meeting at your earliest convience. DON'T PANIC."

    Your personal locker is in the corner.
  exits:
    your-locker-keypad: check your locker
    corridor: through the door

    The keypad glows unethusiastically. You can't remember the code, but you're sure it'll come back to you.
  exits:
    your-cabin: back
