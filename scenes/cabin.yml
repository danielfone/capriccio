    Conciousness gradually returns. You feel slightly groggy. How much time has passed?
  exits:
    your-cabin: wake up, slowly

    You come to in your cabin. The opulent burn of a Pan Galactic Gargle
    Blaster still lingers on your throat. You feel a strange sense of deja vu.
    Your head throbs in time with the ship's engines.

    The ship's engines?! Hadn't they been off? You remember being on
    the float… the vertigo of open space… you were looking for something.

    An overly cheerful sounds over the intercom: "Good morning all passengers,
    welcome to day TypeError: date is null. Starship Enterprises is pleased to
    announce that we are scheduled to shortly reach the Jovian system. Please
    report to the galley for an emergency meeting at your earliest convience."

    Your personal locker is in the corner.
  exits:
    your-locker-keypad: check your locker

    The keypad glows unethusiastically. You can't remember the code, but you're sure it's something simple.
  lock:
    prompt: "PIN Code"
    answer: "1234"
    opens: your-locker
    errors:
      - "That is not the correct password"
      - "Try again"
      - The Gargle Blaster lingers. Maybe you don't remember yet…
  exits:
    your-cabin: back

    You coast sideways through the door to your cabin and your locker hangs above you.
  exits:
    your-locker-keypad: open locker

  name: Your open locker

    You open your locker. The mag boots are turning slowly behind a half-empty bottle
    of Ol' Janx Spirit, as the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger bumps gently against
    other assorted bottles. It occurs to you that you've never tried to mix a
    Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the float before.

    Now that the emergency is over, you feel a little more relaxed. You could use a drink.

    Surely the engines can wait a little longer.
  exits:
    a-drink: against your better judgement, mix a drink

- id: a-drink
  name: One drink in
  description: |
    You mix the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster as if you've done it a thousand times before. You drink it… carefully.

    It feels, as they say, like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

    You feel better now, more confident, more alive. You consider looking for the others to celebrate your success. But first…
  exits:
    a-hazy-return: "just one more drink :)"
